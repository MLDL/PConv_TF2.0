# PConv_TF2.0
Unofficial implementation of PConv paper in TF2.0

Original paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07723.pdf

This is a minimalistic implementation with all the code in one ipython notebook
that is (hopefully) easy to read and understand.

The code in the notebook uses Places2 dataset to train, although I did not finish
training it (that would take way to much time).

Examples of outputs are shown below:
